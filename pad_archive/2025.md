**Decision general Structure:**

Inhaltliche Skizze (Vorschlag):

-	Basierend auf bestehender Vereinsarbeit
-	Komposition bestehender Module und Ergänzung um RSE-Kurse statt reiner Komposition mit RSE-Fokus
-	Setzt MNT-Studis (MINT ohne Informatik) als erstes Profil (die anderen kommen aber danach)
-	Drei generische Module: gen_programming, gen_datascience und gen_software_engineering
-	Drei MNT Module: mnt_wildcard (normales MNT Fachstudium), mnt_compwildcard (normales MNT-computational-Fachstudium  z.b. computational Physics) und mnt_project (lab oder project im Fachstudium mit computational Bezug)
-	Sieben auszuarbeitende RSE-Module: rse_missingsemester (Tooling / Environment angelehnt an MIT Missing Semester ), rse_programming, rse_softwareengineering, rse_computing (HPC, Parallele Programmierung etc.),  rse_management (Management von Softwareprojekten), rse_theory (Wissenschaftstheory und abstrakte Modellierung von Prozessen), rse_thesis (computational Masterarbeit ev. mit Fachpartner)


Decisions:
- add pillar structure as a leading chapter and reference modules that implement parts of the pillars
- write technical outline and call for minimal-workshop proposal
- use module structure above as starting point for the workshop organizations

### Who is here

Florian, Frank, Jan, Gerasimos, Jean-Noël, Nicholas, Jeremy

**Goal:** Get content from Institutionalized Education workshop pads to GitHub, review it before the meeting, and use the meeting to structure the paper according to the latest content. We do the restructuring in breakout sessions together.

Till this meeting, who wants to have done what:

- Florian:
    - [x] Future: Make the Future/End paper LaTeX code build
       - https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/end_of_RSEng/pull/2
- Gerasimos:
    - [x] Future: Read the content
        - https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/end_of_RSEng/issues/1#issuecomment-2747300757
        - Format the notes from the pad (if these are not already in LaTeX) -> Let's settle on goals first.
    - [x] Competencies: Work on the two assigned issues from the review
    - [ ] Institutions: Transfer pillar 4 notes to GitHub

### Agenda

- status payment Dagstuhl seminar thing. -> postponed
- report on Soc-RSE vs teachingRSE meeting
  - Suggest 14.04 to invite other group
  - See [notes from common meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Fvp9HBWHCs_BxSLWaC09evG4q7qQivPTd8eRsN3YVw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.hc4ziwv652tv), [Teaching and Training SIG](https://society-rse.org/teaching-and-training-sig/)
- GC: Overlap between "The End of RSE" and the [call to action](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/call_to_action)? Do we want to merge both into a "Future of RSE and the RSE Education"? A "call to action" is partially included in every teachingRSE paper.
  - No. Let's really keep it separate: a short report from the workshop vs a larger "future" paper.
  - Nick: Career Paths
  - Gerasimos, Jan: Usability + Abstraction
  - Definition RSE: Jean-Noel (PR [#3](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/end_of_RSEng/pull/3))

- 15 Participants for workshop
- Discussion Pillars
- Meta-question: non-specificity still relevant? e.g. that it's not focused on Germany.
  - decide on questions
    - Pillar 1:
      - What is the interaction between scientists brought up in a digital environment and specialized RSEs 10 years from now?
    - Pillar 2: 
      - What support/ incentives can we provide at the different stages of the academic lifecycle to make becoming an RSE easier/ more attractive?
    - Pillar 3:
      - What policy/incentives needs to be implemented at a university(Leibniz, MPG, ...) and at a national level, such that these networks/institutions will be created?
    - Pillar 4:
      - **Main:** Given a teachingRSE department, where in your existing courses/study programs/graduate school could you integrate their services?
      - Statistics questions:
        - Which existing courses or seminars/structures at your university could be embedded in a RSE curriculum, or inversely, could be extended to teach RSE?
        - Examples of students attending a "Git basics for " vs "Git basics".
        - Which existing study programs are currently being extended to provide RSE skills? These could use support from proper institutes.
        - Which labs are investing significant amount of time training their newcomers in RSE skills (besides details on specific software) before they can start being productive?
        - In which non-typical software jobs are RSE skills listed in job descriptions? -> Structure
        - How many RSEs are needed? e.g. as RSE per Researcher: Structure: an estimate + some reasoning
        - The Roadmap to setting up an education track. Which stakeholders do you need to involve: Anecdote collection

  - discuss Merge requests for initial paper draft(Note to Florian: maybe along the lines of merge first - fix later)

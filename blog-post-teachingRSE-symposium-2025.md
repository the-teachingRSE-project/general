For the last two days of the work year 2025, the teaching RSE working group of the deRSE society met in Dresden for the Symposium on Teaching Research Software Engineering in Germany.
Given the national scope of the participants and the train chaos in the days before christmas led to a more flexible beginning of the symposium.
The people who arrived on time used the opportunity to drink coffee and catch up with various research software engineering topics.

Guido Juckeland gave the first presentation on teaching RSEng at the TU Dresden.
The course comprises typical RSE topics: shell, working in teams, licensing, testing and CI/CD, build systems and software publications.
Teaching is done in lectures and practicals. The students first work on individual project during the first half and then on group projects during the second half.
I really liked the idea to use the flake8 python linter for marking. It was not surprising that genAI popped up.
Fredo Erxleben was wondering how to ensure that the students do not overly rely on genAI for code generation.
They did find that using genAI for test-driven development worked pretty well since the students have to carefully think about the tests so that they can prompt the LLM.
We came to the conclusion that you cannot stop people from using genAI.
However, they should be made aware of the various issues and be transparent about their use of the technology by, for example, making a declaration of AI use.
One way to check that they understand what they did is to ask the students to give a presentation of their project.
The team at the TU Dresden hoped that the students would produce reproducible jupyter notebooks.
In practise, they stuck to the scaffolding and did not add much documentation. Students probably need to be guided more explicitly.

The term "Research Software Engineer" has now been around for over 10 years. 
In the time since it was first "created" back in 2012, we have seen many developments in how people undertaking software engineering are recognised and supported within the research community.
However, these advances have largely followed slightly different pathways in different countries.
In Germany this has been represented through the creation, growth and formalisation of the deRSE community, representing people building and maintaining research software across a range of roles.
In the German research community, particularly within universities, the job title "Research Software Engineer" is still fairly unusual - many of the people developing research software have roles that classify them as researchers or academics.

In this BoF session, we will look at current career structures for RSEs in Germany and also consider international developments in RSE.
We'll then look at what we, as a community, see as the most important areas where the RSE role can and should be developed in Germany, and how we think career pathways for research software professionals can be improved.
The session will begin with a group of short talks by invited people for around 30 minutes to set the scene.

We will then move into a "fishbowl"-style panel discussion of 60 mins.
In this model, we'll begin with a group of four invited panellists but also 1 empty seat.
As the discussion gets going, we'll invite an audience member with points that they'd like to contribute to join the panel taking the empty seat.
Going forward we'll continue to invite audience members to join the panel with existing panel members stepping down and returning to the audience.

This approach will give us the opportunity to hear a wide range of perspectives and input in an equitable and flexible manner.

The key things that we hope to get out of this BoF session are:

- An improved understanding of the challenges RSEs have or the concerns they face around career progression.
- Community perspectives on suitable career pathways for technical roles.
- Approaches for engaging with key stakeholders to promote greater awareness and recognition of the importance of supporting technical roles.

We see this development of career pathways for RSEs as a long-term challenge for our community and we therefore hope that this will be a session that we can run annually at deRSE,
reviewing progress over the past year and looking at how we can catalyse further change.
